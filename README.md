# Information Security
Information Security laboratory work<sub>s</sub>

### Application purpose:
* Encrypt and decrypt user credentials (username, password) with some serious steps :neutral_face: that involve focal brain power.
* Block access to websites using domain names (on Unix systems, using **iptables**).
* Block access to websites using domain names or IP addresses (on Windows, using .../etc/hosts and firewall rules respectively).

### What it can? :open_mouth:
* Register new users encrypted credentials into a file (a.k.a. users_db).
* Attempt logging in by decrypting and verifying provided credentials with the saved ones.
* Be aware of the session. <sub>BUT IT DOESN'T</sub>
* Automatically decide which services to use and eliminate depending on the operation system.
* Beautifully display all data that is being manipulated (whether users or blocked domains + ip addresses).
* Do regex verification of entered addresses.
* Talk with you...
* *CRASH* :hammer: :boom:, to prevent system file damages <sub>(in case, there are existing entries that need to be deleted by the application)</sub>.

### What else? :man_facepalming:
* Refreshing, handâ€“crafted, intuitive user interface.
* Informational modal boxes.
* Amazingly **Dry** and highly **Clean** code
* Secret, ~~<sup>blessing</sup>~~ word in Chinese
